# image-classifier
We are given a dataset consisting of various classes with equal number of images of each category. We have to build a predictive model using machine learning algorithms which depend on their training and testing on this dataset. Finally, the model after testing is deployed to classify an given image into a category using the model that we had made. Final answer will be a based on expectation using probabilities generated.

We are using kNN classifier and CNN to classify the given CIFAR-10 datasets 
K-nearest neighbor is a method in which we take the votes of k no. of nearest points to the given point and assume it to be of the same class as majority. k-NN is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until classification. The k-NN algorithm is among the simplest of all machine learning algorithms.
Both for classification and regression, it can be useful to assign weight to the contributions of the neighbors, so that the nearer neighbors contribute more to the average than the more distant ones.
