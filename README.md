Title :-


Object Recognition: Identification and classification of an image among ten different classes of objects.    


Problem Definition :- 


We are given a dataset consisting of various classes with equal number of images of each category. We have to build a predictive model using machine learning algorithms which depend on their training and testing on this dataset. Finally, the model after testing is deployed to classify an given image into a category using the model that we had made. Final answer will be a based on expectation using probabilities generated.
